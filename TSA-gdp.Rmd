## Basic Time Series Analysis

This part is for basic time series analysis on Quarterly GDP data **(source:IMF)**. The dataset used here includes

```{r gdp_data1}

source("gdp_data1.R")

```

There are total 74 rows using `nrow()` formula which means 74 quarters equivalent to around 18 years data. Now to apply times series it is important to convert the data in **TS (Time Series)** format 

```{r ts_gdp_data1_plot}

options(scipen = 100, digits = 4)

ts_gdp_data1 <- with(Nominal_gdp_unadjusted_rs, ts(NGDP_NSA_XDC, start = c(Year[1], Quarter[1]), freq = 4))

ts_plot(ts_gdp_data1,
        title = "India Quarterly Gross Domestic Product (Nominal - Undjusted) at Domestic Currency",
        Xtitle = "Period",
        Ytitle = "Rs in Million",
        slider = TRUE,
        color = "Red",
        width = 3,
        line.mode = "lines+markers"
        )


```
